Azure App Service is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that offers a platform for web, mobile and API applications. Applications running on App Service subscriptions are guaranteed a 99.95% availability (SLA). The service is ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant thus offering excellent security right out of the box.

Developers can just focus on writing their application, without having to worry about setting up the infrastructure or maintaining and patching frameworks, Operating Systems, etc.

App Service also allows users to readily scale up and scale out their applications without much configuration, and it also handles load balancing and traffic management for your applications.

With user-friendly and easy to set up features like these, App Service shines through in various scenarios and is an excellent choice for a myriad of applications.

Here are some example scenarios where App Service can be useful:

- **Teams with limited bandwidth**:
  You're part of a small team of developers who want to focus on building out your application or product without giving too much bandwidth to actualize the application. In such a case, App Service will be an excellent choice with its fully managed infrastructure, automatic scaling, and load balancing capabilities.

- **Single Tenant Secure Deployments**:
  To satisfy internal security and compliance requirements, App Service Environments can be used to achieve greater isolation and satisfy single tenancy requirements. These can also be run on dedicated hardware depending on the requirements.

- **Testing Features and deploying into Production without downtime**:
  Using deployment slots in App Service, one can take advantage of multiple stages of deployment and easily test out new features. This eliminates downtime as the new deployment is already warm when it's swapped. Thus, using a deployment slot, you can test out your pre-production application, once you're satisfied with these deployments, you can swap it into production.

The above scenarios are just some of the use-cases where App Service can be useful. However, App Service is versatile enough to be useful across multiple use cases.

You should thus, consider using App Service when:

- You want to focus on your application without worrying about managing and maintaining the infrastructure that your application runs on.
- You want to provide rigorous security and compliance standards to your deployments, without having to manually set it up.
- You want easy scale up and scale out capabilities on a global scale without much developer intervention.
