In this module, you learned about Azure’s App Service-a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) for developers to create flexible mobile, web and API applications.

You also learned the importance of Azure’s App Service and its suitable implementation in the business landscape for tailoring innovative solutions.

Common use-cases of App Service include:

- When the user wants to focus on the application rather than on the infrastructural set-up management
- When the user deployments must be integrated rigorous security and regulatory compliance standards
- When the application demands rapid upscaling without developer intervention

These enterprise-ready solutions could be deployed on a reliable cloud-based infrastructure that could be scaled globally.
