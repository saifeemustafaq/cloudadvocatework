Companies producing applications have many concerns they need to address while developing and hosting an application and make sure it can be used by its customers. These concerns mean that a lot of resources might need to be spent on personnel and hardware.

## Some of these concerns are:

- **Hosting**: To host an app, depending on the size of your company, you might need to buy servers, install operating systems, and finally install an application server before you're able to host your app. Using the cloud, and a service like Azure App Service, means you can focus on the application code. Azure App Service is a serverless offering from Microsoft, hence the all the underlying infrastructure and servers are managed and maintained by Microsoft.

- **Maintenance**: Depending on how your app is hosted, maintenance might mean everything from updating code to patching operating systems. Tasks like that can keep a whole IT department busy. Using a platform like Azure App Service means maintenance isn't something you care about.

- **Release and deployment**: As you're making changes to your apps, you want to deploy these changes in a careful way, which might include the use of staging environment to ensure what you are about to deploy will work. Azure App Service offers something called deployment slots to ensure deployments can be previewed before you deploy things live.

- **Scaling**: For different periods of the year like holidays or during sales, your traffic might be increase. A company not using the cloud might resort to having to buy and start up servers to meet demand. Azure App Server can scale elastically to both scale up to meet demand but also scale down when traffic is no longer at peak levels.

## Scenario

Assume that Contoso Inc., a small business, wants to offer e-commerce services for musical instruments and accessories through their company website. They're self-hosting the app, meaning they've invested in infrastructure and a dedicated operations team. They have recently encountered major server outages, impacting their business critically. The website is maintained by their operations team with a limited workforce on a limited budget. Providing a customer with a seamless experience is becoming increasingly challenging, especially when the demand is enormous.

In this regard, a service such as Azure App Service by Microsoft can effectively come into action. Azure App Service is a serverless platform where the platform handles hardware, patching, scaling, and more. Azure App Services is cost efficient as it provides multiple pricing tiers matching with your business requirements. Azure App Service also addresses app availability of your app since your app will be hosted on a network of highly secure and fault-tolerant servers distributed worldwide to assure app availability.

On top of that, Azure App Service manages the concerns of load balancing, autoscaling, service discovery and infrastructure maintenance all by itself. Furthermore, constant telemetry allows improving app performance and helps obtaining visibility into app health.

By migrating the web app into cloud, Contoso Inc. can get rid of their major concerns and focus on the appâ€™s business logic and business data instead. In a nutshell, adoption of Azure App Service can effectively boost corporate efficiency and reduce the need for resources.
