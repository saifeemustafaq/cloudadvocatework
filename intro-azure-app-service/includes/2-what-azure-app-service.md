Azure App Service is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) offering for developers. What is a PaaS though?

## PaaS, platform as a service

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications.

The idea is that you develop your application and all other details around hosting is managed for you by a PaaS. You bring your app, and its code, to a platform. The platform manages about hosting and how to keep itself updated and it’s not something a developer needs to care about or manage, other than leveraging its features.

The cloud has gone through many iterations. You started in a physical server room that you owned and maintained. Then came the next generation, IaaS, infrastructure as a service. With the IaaS paradigm, you didn’t own servers or any hardware but still specified what hardware you needed but in the Cloud.

The current generation PaaS, platform as a service is a fully managed platform that abstracts away any need for you to care about what hardware runs the platform. Instead, you focus on high-level concepts like how to store your app or how scale or deploy it.

PaaS is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.

## What is App Service?

Azure App Service is a fully managed web application hosting platform. This platform as a service (PaaS) offering by Azure allows you to focus on designing and building your app while Azure takes care of the infrastructure to run and scale your applications.

It enables developers to host web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends in the programming language of their choice without managing things like runtime, middleware, app servers and more.

It lets users create enterprise-ready web apps faster for any platform or device and deploy them on a scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure.

### Key features and benefits of App Service

Here are some key features and benefits you get when using App Service.

- **Fully Managed Environment**: It automatically patches and maintains the operation system and language frameworks. The user gets the time to focus on designing, developing and maintaining his applications and data.
- **Multiple languages and frameworks**: App Service support for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python.
- **Containerization and Docker**: Custom windows or Linux containers can be hosted in App Service.
- **Scalability**: Based on demand App, Service can scale up or down resources manually or automatically.
- **Security and compliance**: App Service is ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant. Azure Active Directory, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Microsoft account can be used to authenticate the users.
- **DevOps optimization**: Continuous integration and deployment are another benefit. Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry can be used to streamline CI/CD.
