  questions:
    - content: Azure Container Apps uses Kubernetes as Orchestration mechanism to
        deploy and manage containers
      choices:
        - content: It uses an Orchestration, which is native to Azure
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. It uses Kubernetes as Orchestrator to deploy and manage
            containers
        - content: Correct. it uses Kubernetes as Orchestrator to deploy and manage
            containers
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Orchestration is the responsibility of the end user; Azure only
            provides the infrastructure

          explanation: Incorrect. It uses Kubernetes as Orchestrator to deploy and manage
            containers
    - content: An AKS cluster has to be provisioned prior to the deployment of an
        Azure Container App Environment
      choices:
        - content: This will be taken care of by the Container App service
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Container App service makes it completely a black box for
            end user by managing the entire kubernetes infrastructure
        - content: A basic AKS cluster has to be present while deploying a Container App
            Environment
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Container App service makes it completely a black box
            for end user by managing the entire kubernetes infrastructure
        - content: A Kubernetes cluster has to be provisioned. It can be a cluster of any
            kind - managed or unmanaged, running on Azure Infrastructure

          explanation: Incorrect. Container App service makes it completely a black box
            for end user by managing the entire kubernetes infrastructure
    - content: A Single Azure Container App environment is mapped to an AKS cluster
        behind the scene
      choices:
        - content: There's a 1:1 mapping between a container App Environment and an AKS
            cluster behind the scene
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Although for Preview version, the mapping is 1:1 but
            ultimate goal is to make it a black box for the end users. So the
            deployment can actually happen across multiple clusters,
            availability zones etc.
        - content: The mapping is between a container App Environment and an unmanaged K8s
            cluster behind the scene chosen by Container App runtime
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Although for Preview version, the mapping is 1:1 but
            ultimate goal is to make it a black box for the end users. So the
            deployment can actually happen across multiple clusters,
            availability zones etc.
        - content: This is completely a black box for the users; Container App service
            decides this based on various parameters
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Although for Preview version, the mapping is 1:1 but
            ultimate goal is to make it a black box for the end users. So the
            deployment can actually happen across multiple clusters,
            availability zones etc.
