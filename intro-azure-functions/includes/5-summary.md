In this module, we explained what Azure Functions is. It’s a serverless compute platform. It’s capable of leverage concepts like triggers, to define when your code should run and bindings to easily connect to data sources. The results are functions that usually are just a few lines of code.

We also covered when to use Azure Function. There are many good use cases, but some cases are real-time processing of data, time-based jobs, notifications and in general code that should run for a reason.
