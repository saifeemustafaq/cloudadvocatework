## Introduction

Azure Static Apps is a modern app service that automatically builds and deploys full-stack apps in Azure, from source code to global high availability.

They're built and deployed based on the changes in the code. Every time you commit changes in the code, Azure directly interacts with the code through GitHub or Azure DevOps and your app is deployed in Azure - This is a key feature of Azure static Apps.

## Scenario

Your Company (Let’s say, Bookify) is launching a Book store App to keep a track of Customer’s orders. Through this site, customers can add, edit, view, and remove items such as Books and stationary items from their list.

The site and APIs (where you implement the server-side logic) need to be secure to ensure customer privacy. Your users will be distributed all over the world, so you want to ensure great performance regardless of where your customers are.

You’d prefer a solution that removes as much of the infrastructure and hosting work, including building and publishing, as possible, so you can concentrate on all the features and good user experience. You also want to ensure your solution can run on a custom domain for branding reasons.
