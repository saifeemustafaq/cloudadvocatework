The goal here was to help you decide whether Azure Static apps would be a good choice for your business process. You looked at several features where the primary concern was to limit the amount of infrastructure work and focus on the business features and user experience.
Finally, it's a streamlined, highly efficient solution to take your static apps from source code to global high availability.

Azure Static Web Apps is a great fit for the following scenario:

- Performance and Scale: Your web assets are globally distributed, putting them closer to your users, to minimize latency and business logic is run on Azure Functions that scale automatically to meet demand.
- Productivity: You get an automated build pipeline with CI/CD.
- Security: The web app is secured with an SSL certificate.

With Azure Static Web Apps, you could deploy your web assets to cloud storage, create, and assign your own SSL certificate, create your API, establish a reverse proxy that allows your app to make calls to the API, distribute the app globally, and set up your own CI/CD process.
Azure Static Web Apps gives you all of these benefits. This approach lets you spend your time on building new features and optimizing the user experience rather than creating and maintaining site infrastructure.

In summary, Azure Static Web Apps service is something you actively think about when you first deploy the app and the cloud resources, and the workflow is created. For most other code changes the focus is on authoring code and checking it in via Git, the GitHub workflow takes care of any deployment in the background. You can at any time configure auth or add a backend, in which case you would need to interact with the configuration files that the service knows to look for.
