In this module, we evaluated whether Azure SignalR Service is a good option for creating applications with real-time communications capabilities by considering factors such as scalability, support for multiple clients, communication latency.

We applied these decision criteria in our chat room application scenario. We determined that for our chat room web application, we'll want a service with scalability capabilities, support for many clients for any chat participant who may want to join to the conversation via JavaScript client browsers, and low communication latency.

However, hosting a SignalR server yourself isn't a simple task, and it can be difficult to scale and secure properly. Using the fully managed Azure SignalR Service solves the issue of hosting for you.

Our criteria helped you evaluate whether the Azure SignalR Service is the right service to apply for your real-time applications. You considered the communication latency; multiple clients support and scalability, which you would like to integrate in such application.

You now have enough information to decide whether Azure SignalR Service meets your applicationâ€™s requirement for real-time communication applications.
