Real-time communication involves many channels, including telephone, instant messaging, VoIP, and live chat. A regular web application will perform a complete cycle from the client to server for the entire page and all its parts when something is performed. This puts a strain on the server to serve the content and increases the usage of CPU and memory on the server.

With Azure SignalR Service, you can send anything to the server and the server can send anything back to the client at any time, without completely following the request/response cycle.

Azure SignalR Service can update connected applications in real time over HTTP without the need for the applications to poll for updates or submit new HTTP requests. This enables you to create seamless web experiences that update information on the fly without having to refresh the service.

### Example scenarios

There are many cases where real-time communication improves the user experience. Here are some examples:

- **Auction app**: Suppose you're building an auction application. To ensure an engaging and smooth experience for your users, you want to update them in real-time when changes happen. This will provide a better experience than the user refreshing the web page themselves. For this use case, you can use Azure SignalR.
- **The intelligent home**: Imagine you have a set of IoT devices connected in a home. You want to be able to send messages to these devices and receive messages from devices when important events occur.
- **Finance app**: The stock market has many events that happen in real-time, and you might want to initiate a sale or purchase depending on the value of a stock.

### What will you learn?

You will:

- Evaluate whether your app will benefit from using Azure SignalR Service.
- Describe how Azure SignalR Service is used for real-time communication between components.

### What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll have evaluated Azure SignalR Service and learned how it's used in real-time communication between components.
