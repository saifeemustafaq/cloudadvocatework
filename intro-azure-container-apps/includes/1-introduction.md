Azure Container Apps is an offering from Microsoft Azure that enables you to run **microservices** and **containerized applications** on a serverless platform.

Azure Container Apps allows you to run application code bundled in any container, regardless of the runtime or programming model used.

With Container Apps, you get the benefits of running containers without having to worry about maintaining cloud infrastructure or sophisticated container orchestrators.

## Features

Here's some features that makes Azure Container Apps a compelling choice:

- **Run multiple container** revisions and manage the container app's application lifecycle.

- **Run containers from any registry**, public or private, including Docker Hub and Azure Container Registry (ACR).

- **Use the Azure CLI extension or ARM templates** to manage your applications.

- **View application logs** using Azure Log Analytics.

- **Autoscale** your apps based on any KEDA-supported (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) scale trigger. Most applications can scale to zero.

- [\*Split traffic\*\* across multiple versions of an application for Blue/Green deployments and A/B testing scenarios.

- **Enable HTTPS ingress** without having to manage other Azure infrastructure.

- **Use internal ingress and service discovery** for secure internal-only endpoints with built-in DNS-based service discovery.

- **Build microservices with Dapr** and access its rich set of APIs.

- **Provide an existing virtual network** when creating an environment for your container apps.

- **Securely manage secrets** directly in your application.

## Scenario

Your team is looking for a platform that is portable, expandable, and cost efficient for managing containerized workloads and services. Your application also consists of multiple services running in different containers and you need a solution where you can manage multiple containers with ease to accelerate—development, test, and production cycles. Along with excellent container orchestration, you also need a secure and trustable platform for deploying your Containerized application.
