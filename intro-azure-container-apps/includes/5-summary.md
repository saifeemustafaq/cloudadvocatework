Azure Container Apps is a serverless container service built for microservice applications with robust autoscaling capabilities. Using containers, you can create microservices, APIs, event-processing workers, and background jobs.

You can write code in your choice language and use the built-in Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) to accelerate development.

Azure container apps provide you flexibility you need without the expense of managing sophisticated infrastructure.

Along with security provided by Microsoft across physical datacenters, infrastructure, and operations in Azure, Azure container apps is a compelling option to deploy and manage your containerized applications.
